This can let users to find out the relevant tasks easily. One of the existed product is quite similar to our application which are using one-line command to control the application. However, the interface of this software need to be improved. Therefore, interface, having priority for tasks and tags for tasks are some important features.

## FAQ
**Q**: Can I add event which have a start date and time to my to-do list ?<br>

**A**: Yes, you can create an event by typing command with a start and end date. For example, you have a trip from 10/10/2016 8:00 to 13/10/2016 21:00. You can type command like this: `add trip starts 8am 10th October ends 9pm 13th October`.

**Q**: If I don't know the deadline of my task yet, can I still add my task?<br>

**A**: Yes, you can still add your task. You can create a floating task by only type in command `add TASK_NAME` if you don't know the deadline of your task.

<img src="images/MESS_004.png" width="600"><br>

In this example, you can see shopping is a floating task without a start time and end time.

**Q**: What can I do if I forget those commands?<br>

**A**: You can use the help command or click help tab on the top which will give you a list of command summary. Even if you type the wrong command format, MESS will show you the correct command hints.
