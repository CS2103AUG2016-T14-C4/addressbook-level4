In summary, there are a few strengths that the existing products have. They all have simple interfaces so that users can look at their to-do lists in a clear way. Many of them have notifications and priority which can be set for each task which is good for user to find urgent task. Categorize tasks is another key point for most of the products. This can let users to find out the relevant tasks easily. One of the existed product is quite similar to our application which are using one-line command to control the application. However, the interface of this software need to be improved. Therefore, interface, priority for tasks and the tag for tasks are some important features.

## FAQ
**Q**: Can I add event which have a start date and time to my to-do list ?<br>

**A**: Yes, you can create an event by typing command with a start and end date. For example, you have a trip from 10/10/2016 8:00 to 13/10/2016 21:00. You can type command like this: `add trip s/8am 10th October c/9pm 13th October`.
       
**Q**: If I don't know the deadline of my task yet, can I still add my task?<br>

**A**: Yes, you can still add your task. You can create a floating task by only type in command `add TASK_NAME` if you don't know the deadline of your task.

In this example, you can see shopping is a floating task without a start time and deadline.
